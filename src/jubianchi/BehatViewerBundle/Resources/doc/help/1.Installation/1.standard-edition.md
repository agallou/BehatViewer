# Install standard edition

The Behat Viewer installation process is pretty simple : you will only have to follow three simple steps!

## First step : download & unzip

Download the Behat Viewer Standard Edition archive from GitHub : [https://github.com/jubianchi/BehatViewer/zipball/master](https://github.com/jubianchi/BehatViewer/zipball/master).

When the download is done, simply unzip the content of this archive in your web root (e.g ```/var/www```)

If you are too lazy to do this, copy the following command : they'll do the job for you :

~~~
$ wget -O /tmp/behat-viewer.zip https://github.com/jubianchi/BehatViewer/zipball/master

$ unzip /tmp/behat-viewer.zip /var/www

$ rm /tmp/behat-viewer.zip
~~~

## Second step : application configuration



## Third step : setup the application

Finally, you will be able to launch the ```install``` command which will setup Apache and crete MySQL schema :

~~~
$ sudo app/console behat-viewer:install
~~~

If you want to tweak the virtualhost configuration, fell free to edit the file : the one given by the command and a simple starter configuration.
